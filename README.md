### Student at 42 Heilbronn - Core Curriculum

Hey there! I'm a programmer since 2019. My first Contact with code was Rust, but the first language I learned is C.
I'm currently studying at 42 Heilbronn and I publish here some of the projects I do during my curriculum. But I have personal projects as well, they are (or will be) also published here. My latest project is miniRT, a raytracer written in C, from the core curriculum. As it is a project done in a team of two, it's published on mhahnFr's Github [here](https://github.com/mhahnFr/42cursus-miniRT "miniRT").

### My programming languages are:
